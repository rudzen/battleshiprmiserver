/**
 * A concrete implementation of an {@code Interval} over any naturally
 * ordered type.
 * <p>
 * Each {@code GenericInterval} contains a lower endpoint value and an
 * upper endpoint value such that the result of
 * {@code upper.compareTo(lower)} must be zero or greater. In other words,
 * the upper endpoint must be equal to or greater than the lower endpoint
 * according to the natural ordering of the interval basis type.</p>
 * <p>
 * For example, if an {@code GenericInterval&lt;Integer&gt;} object (an
 * interval of integers) has a lower endpoint value of zero then its upper
 * endpoint value must be zero or greater. If an
 * {@code GenericInterval&lt;Character&gt;} (an interval of character
 * values) had a lower endpoint value of {@code 'a'} then its upper
 * endpoint value would have to be <code>'a'</code> or {@code 'b'} or any
 * other character which causes {@code upper.compareTo(lower)} to return
 * zero or greater.</p>
 * <p>
 * If an endpoint is {@code null} then it means that the endpoint is
 * unbounded and there is no limit to what is included in that direction. So a
 * {@code null} lower endpoint means that the lower endpoint is unbounded
 * and the interval includes every value which is less than the upper endpoint
 * value; a {@code null} upper endpoint means that the upper endpoint is
 * unbounded and the interval includes every value greater than the lower
 * endpoint value; and if both endpoints are {@code null} then all values
 * are included in this interval. In effect, a lower endpoint of
 * {@code null} equates to a lower endpoint having the value negative
 * infinity, and an upper endpoint of {@code null} equates to an upper
 * endpoint having the value positive infinity. Note that {@code null}
 * itself is <strong>never</strong> included in an interval, as
 * {@code null} represents the lack of a value. Be aware that
 * {@code null} endpoints will allow any value of the permitted type,
 * including values such as {@code Double.NaN} (which is supposed to
 * represent a non-value value).</p>
 * <p>
 * Also note that a type constant which is intended to represent infinity, such
 * as {@code Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY}, is just another numeric value so
 * far as the {@code Comparable} interface is concerned, and is therefore
 * just another member of the naturally ordered set Double so far as
 * {@code Interval&lt;Double&gt;} is concerned. Specifying such a value for
 * an endpoint is not the same as specifying {@code null} because
 * {@code null} will admit any value belonging to the interval basis type,
 * whereas a pseudo-infinite value such as {@code Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY}
 * will exclude any values which are beyond it in the natural order of the basis
 * type. For example, {@code Double.NaN} is considered greater than
 * {@code Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY} and also greater than
 * <code>Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY</code> according to the {@code compareTo}
 * method of {@code Double}.</p>
 * <p>
 * An interval can include zero, one or both of its endpoint values. This is
 * specified by the mode of each endpoint.
 * {@link Interval.EndpointMode#CLOSED EndpointMode.CLOSED} means that the
 * endpoint value itself is included in the interval, while
 * {@link Interval.EndpointMode#OPEN EndpointMode.OPEN} means that the endpoint
 * value itself is not included in the interval. For instance, an
 * {@code Interval&lt;Double&gt;} might have a lower endpoint value of zero
 * and a lower endpoint mode of {@code EndpointMode.OPEN} which means that
 * zero is the lower limit of the interval but is not included in the interval.
 * The endpoint mode is irrelevant for a null endpoint.</p>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Warning:</strong> Because an {@code Interval} relies on the
 * {@code Comparable} interface, everything depends on the result returned
 * by the <code>compareTo</code> method. So be aware that a {@code Double}
 * object with value {@code -0.0} (negative zero) is considered by
 * compareTo to be less in value than a {@code Double} object with value
 * {@code 0.0} (positive zero) even though almost all applications would
 * consider these two values to be identical. Be careful not to allow a negative
 * zero to be used as an endpoint value without understanding that it will be
 * treated differently.</p>
 * <p>
 * Objects of type {@code GenericInterval} cannot be mutated, but it is
 * only safe to consider them truly immutable if they are based on an immutable
 * type. So a {@code GenericInterval&lt;String&gt;} is truly immutable
 * because neither the <code>GenericInterval</code> nor the {@code String}
 * objects acting as endpoints can be mutated. But a
 * {@code GenericInterval&lt;Date&gt;} cannot be considered immutable
 * because even though the {@code GenericInterval} cannot be mutated, the
 * {@code Date} objects acting as endpoints can be mutated. This also means
 * that a {@code GenericInterval} of a mutable type cannot be guaranteed to
 * maintain the order of its endpoints, so the lower endpoint may suddenly be
 * mutated to have a greater value than the upper endpoint. For this reason it
 * is strongly recommended that {@code GenericInterval} is only used with
 * immutable types. If a {@code GenericInterval} is created over a mutable
 * type, then both the {@code GenericInterval} and its endpoint objects
 * must be kept safe, and must not be shared.</p>
